# About Me

I am a fifth year master’s student in the Computer Science department at Carnegie Mellon University. I received my bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences from CMU in 2020. I am jointly advised by Prof. Nihar B. Shah and Prof. Weina Wang. My senior thesis focuses on the privacy-utility tradeoff in peer-review data analysis. My research interest lies in privacy-preserving data analytics and machine learning.
