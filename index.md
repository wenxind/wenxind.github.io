# About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at **University of Chicago**. I am advised by [Prof. Heather Zheng](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Ben Zhao](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on **security and privacy in machine learning**. I received my bachelorâ€™s degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences with a minor in Computational Finance from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. I received my master's degree in Computer Science -- Research Thesis from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021, jointly advised by [Prof. Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Weina Wang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weinaw/){:target="_blank"}.
